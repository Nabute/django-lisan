## [v0.1.3] - 2024-09-28

This release addresses a critical issue in the `Lisan` model where all fields from the main model were being included in the migration, even though only the fields defined in `lisan_fields` were expected to be migrated.

### Fixed
- **Resolved Migration Issue for Lisan Model**:
  - Fixed an issue where the `Lisan` model migrations included all fields from the main model instead of only those listed in the `lisan_fields` attribute.
  - The `LisanModelMeta` metaclass now correctly filters out fields that are not translatable based on the `lisan_fields` list, ensuring that only the intended fields are migrated.
  - Added validation to ensure that any model using `LisanModelMixin` must define `lisan_fields`. If `lisan_fields` is missing, an `AttributeError` is raised during model initialization.

### Improved
- **Automatic Field Filtering in Lisan Model**:
  - The dynamic `Lisan` model generation now strictly adheres to the `lisan_fields` specification, dynamically creating translation models with only the specified translatable fields.

### Migration Notes
- A new migration is required to fix the schema of previously generated migrations for the `Lisan` model. After upgrading, run the following commands:
  
  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

## [v0.1.2] - 2024-09-23

This release focuses on refining the multilingual handling capabilities by introducing additional flexibility in language detection and ensuring compatibility with supported languages.

### Added
- **Enhanced Language Detection in Middleware**:
  - **Improved `LanguageMiddleware`**: The `LanguageMiddleware` now includes more robust language detection mechanisms:
    - It checks for the `lang` query parameter, user profile language preference, cookies, and the `Accept-Language` header in a prioritized manner.
    - Added support for configurable fallback languages via the `LISAN_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` setting.
    - Introduced validation to ensure the selected language is within the list of supported languages, using the new `LISAN_ALLOWED_LANGUAGES` setting.
    - Refined the `Accept-Language` header parsing to handle complex header values and gracefully fallback when necessary.
  
  - **Support for Configurable Allowed Languages**: A new setting, `LISAN_ALLOWED_LANGUAGES`, has been added to specify the languages supported by the application. If a language from the request is not in this list, the middleware falls back to the default language.
  
### Configuration Changes
- **New Settings**:
  - `LISAN_ALLOWED_LANGUAGES`: A list of language codes that the application supports. The `LanguageMiddleware` ensures that only these languages are applied to the request. Defaults to `[LISAN_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE]`.

### Fixed
- Improved robustness in the `LanguageMiddleware` by ensuring safe access to user profile attributes and handling of missing or malformed `Accept-Language` headers.
- Prevented invalid language codes from being set on requests by validating against the new `LISAN_ALLOWED_LANGUAGES` setting.

### Migration Notes
No database migrations are required for this release. However, to take advantage of the new language validation features, developers should define `LISAN_ALLOWED_LANGUAGES` in `settings.py`.

## [v0.1.1] - 2024-09-14

This version brings enhanced flexibility, making the `lisan` package highly adaptable for multilingual projects by enabling external services for automated translations while maintaining a customizable architecture.

### Added
- **Pluggable Translation Service**: Introduced a base `BaseTranslationService` class, allowing easy integration of third-party or custom translation services.
  - Added an example implementation with `GoogleTranslateService` using Googleâ€™s translation API.
  - Enabled dynamic loading of translation services via Django settings (`LISAN_DEFAULT_TRANSLATION_SERVICE`).
  
- **Auto-Translation Support**: 
  - Added an `auto_translate` option to `get_lisan_field` in `LisanModelMixin`, enabling automatic translation fallback when specific language translations are missing.
  - Added auto-translation support in serializers and admin displays for models with translatable fields.

- **Bulk Translation Operations**: Added `set_bulk_lisans` method to support creating or updating translations for multiple languages in bulk.

- **Flexible Field Types**: Enhanced support for additional field types, such as `TextField`, `JSONField`, and more, in translatable models.

- **Customizable Admin Display**: 
  - Introduced `lisan_display_format` for customizing how translated fields appear in the Django admin interface.
  
- **Middleware Improvement**: Enhanced `LanguageMiddleware` to support multiple language detection sources, including query parameters (`?lang=xx`), cookies, and user profile settings.

### Fixed
- Improved fallback language handling for missing translations, with a new configuration (`LISAN_FALLBACK_LANGUAGES`) allowing developers to define custom fallback hierarchies.

### Configuration Changes
- **New Settings**: 
  - `LISAN_DEFAULT_TRANSLATION_SERVICE`: Configure the default translation service dynamically.
  - `LISAN_FALLBACK_LANGUAGES`: Customize fallback languages in case a specific translation is missing.

### Migration Notes
No database migrations are required for this release, but additional configuration in `settings.py` may be necessary to leverage new features like auto-translation and pluggable services.

---

### Future Plans
- Introduce caching for external translation service results to minimize API calls.
- Add support for other translation services such as DeepL and Microsoft Translator.
- Improve manual translation management in the Django admin interface.
